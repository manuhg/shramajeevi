                Kannada, English and Hindi, which are technically accurate and practically applicable. Shramajeevi
                videos are being used widely as training material by KVKs, DTCs, Training Centres, NGOs and other
                organisations. Till 2016 those documentaries were sold in the form of DVDs across India, Sri Lanka and
                Bangladesh. We have shared these agricultural videos with many TV channels across India and other
                countries. Media organisations from Kenya, Afghanistan, Hong-Kong, South Korea, Nepal, USA and Sri Lanka
                have telecast our documentaries. Now, from the year 2013, Shramajeevi videos are available online on 3
                YouTube Channels â€“ Shramajeevi Agri Films, AgVid and AgCorp. We are preparing ourselves to launch a

                has an in-house team of agricultural media professionals for writing scripts, translation, voice over
